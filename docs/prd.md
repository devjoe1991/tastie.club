## 1. Introduction & Vision

**tastie.club** is a premium subscription-based platform designed to connect discerning customers with partner restaurants. Our vision is to redefine how people discover and experience new dining opportunities.

For a monthly fee, members gain access to book complimentary, chef-curated tasting menus at a selection of restaurants during their designated off-peak hours.

This creates a symbiotic relationship: restaurants fill otherwise empty seats and have a low-risk opportunity to showcase their culinary specialties to a new audience, while customers get to explore the city's food scene in an exclusive and affordable way. tastie.club positions itself as a more curated and experience-focused alternative to discount-based services like Tastecard.

## 2. Problem Statement

* **For Restaurants:** Off-peak hours (e.g., Tuesday evenings, mid-afternoon on weekdays) lead to empty tables, representing significant lost revenue and operational inefficiency. Traditional marketing can be expensive and offers no guarantee of foot traffic.
* **For Customers:** Exploring new, high-quality restaurants can be expensive. Committing to a full meal at an unknown establishment carries a risk of disappointment. Food enthusiasts often seek unique tasting experiences that go beyond standard menus.

## 3. Goals & Objectives

### Business Goals
* **Primary:** Achieve a critical mass of both paying customer subscribers and active restaurant partners to establish a viable two-sided marketplace.
* **Secondary:** Generate consistent monthly recurring revenue (MRR) through customer subscriptions.
* **Tertiary:** Establish the tastie.club brand as a premium, trusted curator in the food-tech space.

### Product Goals
* **For Customers:** Provide a seamless and elegant platform for discovering and booking unique tasting experiences. Offer clear value through access and exclusivity.
* **For Restaurants:** Deliver a simple, self-service tool to manage off-peak availability and showcase their brand. Provide tangible value by driving guaranteed foot traffic.
* **Phase 1 (MVP) Goal:** Launch a visually stunning landing page to validate the concept and capture initial interest by building separate waitlists for customers and restaurants.

## 4. Target Audience

* **Primary Audience (Customers):** "The Adventurous Foodie"
    * **Demographics:** 25-45 years old, urban professionals, disposable income, tech-savvy.
    * **Motivations:** Loves trying new restaurants, appreciates quality food and unique experiences, active on social media (e.g., Instagram), seeks value but not "cheap" discounts.
* **Secondary Audience (Restaurants):** "The Savvy Restaurateur"
    * **Demographics:** Owners/Managers of independent restaurants or small, quality-focused chains.
    * **Motivations:** Keen to innovate and find new marketing channels, wants to maximize table occupancy, proud of their culinary creations and eager to build a base of loyal, returning customers.

## 6. Design & User Experience (UX)

* **Inspiration:** Jony Ive. The design must be clean, elegant, minimalist, and intuitive. Generous use of white space, perfect alignment, and premium typography are essential.
* **Mood:** Seductive, Appealing, Professional, Modern, Exclusive.
* **Visuals:** The user experience must be highly visual. High-resolution, artistic, and appetizing photography of food is the hero. The UI should feature unique, elegant page dividers to delineate sections.
* **Color Palette:** A sophisticated and inviting primary color theme should be used consistently across the platform to build brand identity.

## 7. Technology Stack

* **Framework:** Next.js (Version 14+) with App Router
* **Styling:** Tailwind CSS (Version 3+)
* **UI Components:** shadcn/ui
* **Backend & Database:** Supabase
* **Authentication:** Supabase SSR (`@supabase/ssr`) package

## 8. Assumptions

* Restaurants are willing to provide complimentary tasting menus in exchange for guaranteed foot traffic and the potential for upselling and repeat business.
* A sufficient number of high-quality restaurants will partner with the service to make the customer subscription valuable.
* Customers will perceive enough value in the curated tasting model to pay a recurring monthly subscription fee.

## 9. Out of Scope (For Now)

* Native mobile applications (iOS/Android).
* A customer review and rating system for restaurants.
* Advanced filtering (e.g., by cuisine type, dietary restrictions).
* In-app social features or user-to-user interaction.
* Full administrative backend for tastie.club staff (will rely on Supabase dashboard initially).
